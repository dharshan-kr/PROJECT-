# 🧠 ML Rules, Conditions, and Ranges  
## Bioacoustic-Based Livestock Stress Monitoring System

This document describes the **rule-based logic, physiological ranges, conditions, and alert criteria** used in the proposed machine learning–based livestock stress detection system.  
The system combines **domain-specific rules** with a **Random Forest classifier** to ensure accurate and reliable stress prediction.

## 1. Physiological Parameter Ranges (Animal-Specific)

The following normal physiological ranges are defined for each animal species based on veterinary standards.

### BOVINE (Cow)
- Temperature: 37.8 – 39.2 °C  
- Pulse Rate: 40 – 80 bpm  
- Respiration Rate: 10 – 30 bpm  

### CANINE (Dog)
- Temperature: 38.0 – 39.2 °C  
- Pulse Rate: 70 – 120 bpm  
- Respiration Rate: 18 – 34 bpm  

### EQUINE (Horse)
- Temperature: 37.2 – 38.3 °C  
- Pulse Rate: 28 – 44 bpm  
- Respiration Rate: 8 – 16 bpm  

### OVINE (Sheep)
- Temperature: 38.5 – 40.0 °C  
- Pulse Rate: 60 – 90 bpm  
- Respiration Rate: 12 – 20 bpm  

### CAPRINE (Goat)
- Temperature: 38.5 – 39.7 °C  
- Pulse Rate: 70 – 80 bpm  
- Respiration Rate: 12 – 20 bpm  

### FELINE (Cat)
- Temperature: 38.1 – 39.2 °C  
- Pulse Rate: 120 – 140 bpm  
- Respiration Rate: 15 – 30 bpm  

### PORCINE (Pig)
- Temperature: 38.7 – 39.8 °C  
- Pulse Rate: 60 – 90 bpm  
- Respiration Rate: 10 – 20 bpm

## 2. Vibration / Bioacoustic Threshold Rules

Bioacoustic activity is evaluated using statistical thresholds:

- Mean vibration value: μ  
- Standard deviation: σ  

### Conditions:
- Abnormal vibration:
Vibration > μ + σ

- Highly abnormal vibration:
Vibration > μ + 2σ

## 3. Rule-Based Scoring Mechanism

Each incoming sensor sample is evaluated using the following scoring logic:

| Condition | Score |
|---------|-------|
| Temperature outside normal range | +1 |
| Pulse rate outside normal range | +1 |
| Respiration rate outside normal range | +1 |
| Vibration exceeds threshold | +1 |

## 4. Stress Level Assignment Rules

Based on the cumulative score:

| Total Score | Stress Level | Label |
|------------|-------------|------|
| 0 – 1 | 0 | Normal |
| 2 | 1 | Moderate Stress |
| ≥ 3 | 2 | High Stress |

These labels are used both for **training** and **validating** the machine learning moDEL
